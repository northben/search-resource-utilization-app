# Search Resource Utilization app

This app provides a dashboard that you can use to identify the Splunk searches that use the most resources.

### Search Resource Utilization dashboard

This dashboard relies on the saved search "search resource utilization base", which can be scheduled to run once daily so that the dashboard is highly-responsive without incurring additional search workload.
